# 👋 Hey there, I'm Muhammad Hamza Shahzad

I'm a full stack developer who enjoys building web apps, tinkering with cloud tools, and learning new tech things along the way. I've worked with some cool teams at SAP, TUI, and Unimed, where I got to write code, break things (occasionally on purpose), and help build useful stuff.

Right now, I’m focused on clean architecture, serverless design, and making complex systems easier to manage — all while keeping the dev experience smooth.

## 🛠️ What I like to work with

- Frontend: React, TypeScript, Tailwind, a bit of Django
- Backend: Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- Cloud: AWS (Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, CDK), Docker, Terraform
- Testing: Jest, Playwright, React Testing Library
- Tooling: GitHub, GitLab CI/CD, Nx Monorepo, Webstorm

I’m a big fan of automating boring things, building systems that are easy to maintain, and shipping value fast 🚀

## 🔍 Some public projects

Here are a few things I've been playing with (more in the private vault 🗄️):

- [**FinTrack Pro**](https://github.com/mhshahzad/fin-track-pro) – a financial dashboard for freelancers
- [**Grammar Correct Project**](https://github.com/mhshahzad/grammar-correct-project) – audio grammar correction with AWS magic
- [**Order Pizza API**](https://github.com/mhshahzad/order-pizza-api) – REST API for a pizza ordering system (and yes, it made me hungry)
- [**React Spreadsheet Validator**](https://github.com/mhshahzad/react-spreadsheet-validator) – Excel/CSV import with auto column matching and validation, now styled with Material UI
